# Artifical Neural Net


## Project 1

`python3 ./project1_empty.py [learning rate] [and | xor | example | graphs]`

learning rate specifies the learning rate for the and, xor, and example cases.

- and: single perceptron with predictions
- xor: single perceptron and a hidden layer network with predictions for each
- example: performs a single step of the example in class and outputs the calculated weights
- graphs: generates loss over epoch graphics for each combo of activation and loss functions

## Project 2 

`python3 ./project2.py`

Running the above command will create NNs for each example problem in project 2, run one step of back propagation, and print weights and bias for each layer.
